# Additional files for AMP mining workflow
This folder includes additional files for the AMP mining workflow that has been utilized to mine novel AMPs from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database.
- filter_for_secreted.py - script to filter for candidate mature sequences with signal peptides predicted in their corresponding parent sequences
- get_putative_AMPs.py - script to get putative AMP sequences from AMPlify predictions
- get_novel_putative_AMPs.py - script to filter for novel putative AMP sequences identified by AMPlify
- uniprot_sprot_eukaryota_combined_prop.tsv - Precursor cleavage information from the rAMPage cleavage module with ProP
